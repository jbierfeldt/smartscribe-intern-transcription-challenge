    "3. decided to create an ordered list of dictionaries to store the text and potentially useful information. The \"role\" of the speaker is a placeholder, currently empty\n",
    "4. have never used Spacy before but prompting chat GPT says it's the best option. installing it\n",
    "5. it took me a while to get spacy to work because my environments were mixed up! (conda vs homebrew)had to do some install/reinstall of jupyter notebook, should have just used VScode...\n",
    "7. using spacy to tokenize, lemmatize, etc. my code has a basic training data set, and then using TfidVectorizer to convert text data into features, then I train a naive bayes classifier to distinguish between providers and patients from the text, and predict those roles. \n",
    "8. Ok! this doesn't work perfectly ({'text': 'No, none at all.', 'original_label': 'A', 'role': 'provider'}\n",
    " is labelled incorrectly. Ideally, I would want to get a large amount of training data and split it into my validation, testing, and training sets. I could comb existing transcripts (ex; i2b2) of patient/provider interactions from online, or make GPT generate them for me (the first one is preferred). I'm currently using Naive Baiyes classifier from scikit-learn, so adding the training-testing split would be a first distinction to make moving forward. Then I would focus on tuning the hyperparameters to optimize performance. I could also switch to a different model. I could improve feature engineering as well. \n"
